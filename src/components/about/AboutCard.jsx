        <p>brief introduction about me?</p>
        <p>I am a creative developer with a passion for UX/UI design. 
            As someone who's always been interested in tech, I took the plunge 
            and enrolled myself into an immersive and rigorous Software Engineering program at Per Scholas. 
            Going from no coding knowledge to making mockups and apps, 
            my goal is to craft visually appealing, user-friendly websites that 
            provide a seamless browsing experience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>In my leisure time, I enjoy playing video games like this <a href='https://www.google.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>one where I made a fan website</a>.</p>
